###What was the upfront cost?

Our upfront costs were around $300, which purchased a refrigerator and bike baskets.
Lab members donated a bicycle and a coffee maker, and the food cabinet and eating table were unused furniture.

###What is the daily cost?
</a>

The marginal meal cost from Whole Foods is around $10.
In addition, we spend around $3 per person per day on food from Costco.
The raw data for these estimates can be found in the [food signup](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahunb86VoFSEdHlaTlZLWmdLZHh3LThMa2xRcG1jcEE&usp=sharing) and [expense](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahunb86VoFSEdEhyaEs2YjZTVTJZeHpENnE0VDJ4bWc&usp=sharing) spreadsheets.

###How much time does it take?
</a>

The lunchtime run to Whole Food can be completed in around 30min on a bike; 15min for travel and 15min for selecting and purchasing food.
The weekly Costco run can be completed in around 60-90min, where 30min is used for travel.
Cleanup is usually done by the group and is thus quick; the Cleanliness <abbr title="Directly Responsible Individual">DRI</abbr> may spend 10min each day on average.

<a id="catering" href="#catering" class="nameTag">
###Why don't we use a catering service?
</a>

Several catering services specifically target small groups like ours which require daily food.
Two examples are [ZeroCater](http://www.zerocater.com/) and [Cater2.me](http://cater2.me/).
However, we found these options to be considerably more expensive than our current procedure, while offering only a small time savings.
