Food for Thought (FFT) is an experiment by [SO(3)](http://vision.ucsd.edu/), the computer vision lab at UCSD, in providing free, healthy, food for lab members.
Though [similar programs exist in industry](http://www.flickr.com/photos/brettlider/sets/154249/), this may be the first attempt to adapt the idea to academia.
We expect this will substantially improve lab happiness, culture, and productivity at a near zero net cost for the lab and its members.

This site tracks the progress of the experiment and may also be used as a starting point for similar initiatives.

* [Methods](methods) describes how we're running the program.
In addition to a high-level description, it provides links to the documents used by SO(3) for internal organization.
These documents provide detailed information on the day-to-day operations.

* [Results](results) describes the ongoing results of the experiment.

Also check out [our blog](blog) and [our mailing list](group).
