##Methods

We provide lunch and dinner on weekdays as well as always-available stocked food.
Here we describe the food we buy, supporting materials we purchased, how we set up our space, the organization of labor, and how expenses are processed.
All expenses are logged in the [expense spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahunb86VoFSEdEhyaEs2YjZTVTJZeHpENnE0VDJ4bWc#gid=0).

###Food
</a>

We primarily purchase the stocked food from Costco and prepared food from Whole Foods.
We prefer organic for foods on the [Dirty Dozen](http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/summary.php) and for milk and coffee, but will buy non-organic when the price premium is too great and the food can be washed.
We avoid red meat, pork, and processed foods for reasons of health and dietary restrictions.
We never purchase junk food.

Some common stocked foods are listed below.
This list is constantly evolving, and <em>each lab member is individually empowered to make purchasing decisions</em>, so long as the cost is reasonable.

* Fruit
	* Bananas
	* Mangoes
	* Apples (Fuji)
	* Strawberries
	* Blueberries
	* Blackberries
	* Tomatoes
	* Avocados
	* Clementines
* Drinks
	* Milk (organic)
	* Soy milk (organic)
	* A variety of Naked juices
	* Coffee (organic)
* Sandwich fixings
	* Bread (organic Alpine Valley Multi Grain with Omega-3)
	* Peanut butter
	* Jelly (organic)
	* Sandwich meat (poultry)
	* Cheese
	* Mustard
	* Smoked salmon (wild)
* Cereal (organic, lots of granola)
* Greek yogurt

We purchase prepared food each day for lunch and dinner, where dinner is just lunch leftovers.
So far, this food has come from the local Whole Foods, which has a large selection.
We use [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahunb86VoFSEdHlaTlZLWmdLZHh3LThMa2xRcG1jcEE&usp=sharing) to determine how much to buy each day and to satisfy dietary restrictions.

We put everything in the vision lab, a room which is lightly used for its lack of windows.
Here are some photos:

###Organization
</a>

Besides the expected miscellanea, the ongoing tasks of the group are:

* Delivering food from Costco weekly
* Delivering prepared food daily
* Maintaining a clean space
* Evangelism
* Process improvement

Members can volunteer for any of these tasks using [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahunb86VoFSEdHJjb0ZJbExKeFBFaVViOXZOczdRSmc#gid=0).

Stocked food must be purchased weekly from Costco.
Generally, we make these runs on Fridays.
Volunteers should have a Costco membership.

Prepared food must be purchased daily by lunchtime.
We generally go to the local Whole Foods, but the food runner can choose to shop anywhere.
The food runner can use the SO(3) bike, shown below (TODO).
Ask Eric for the lock combination.

<a id="cleaning" href="#cleaning" class="nameTag">
####Cleaning
</a>

Each day, one lab member is the directly responsible individual (DRI) for keeping the eating area clean.
The DRI need not do all the work himself, but he is ultimately responsible that the work gets done.
The lab is clean if:

* The surfaces are clean
	* This includes the eating area and the shelves
* The refrigerator is clean
* The coffee machine is clean and empty of old coffee
* The trash cans are not overflowing
* Spoiled food has been tossed
* The food and supplies are neatly organized

<a id="evangelism" href="#evangelism" class="nameTag">
####Evangelism
</a>

For FFT to succeed, it should have an impact that goes beyond SO(3).
Lab members are encouraged to spread the good ideas developed here to other labs.
This includes social media, writing blog posts, working on this site, and word of mouth.

<a id="processImprovement" href="#processImprovement" class="nameTag">
####Process improvement
</a>

For FFT to succeed, it must be continuously improved through the ideas and actions of its members and the wider community.
We gratefully accept all ideas and assistance.
Here are some examples of what members have spontaneously done to help:

* Donate equipment
* Provide feedback on food
* Provide ideas for organization and evangelism
* Reach out to local suppliers who may be interested in supporting our experiment

<a id="expenses" href="#expenses" class="nameTag">
###Expenses
</a>

To request reimbursement for purchases, a lab member must do the following:

* Add the purchase to the [expense spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahunb86VoFSEdEhyaEs2YjZTVTJZeHpENnE0VDJ4bWc#gid=0).
	* Make sure your full name and email address are in the spreadsheet.
* Add your receipt to the SO(3) Dropbox folder with path `Dropbox/SO(3)/FoodForThought/receipts`. Here's a [direct link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/s1btw8o7pasm4o8/356_N6Q7W2).
	* Please follow the file naming conventions.
* Ask <a href="mailto:jhufziger@eng.ucsd.edu">Josh Hufziger</a> to reimburse you, and cc Serge.
	* Mark the date requested in the `reimbursement status` column of the [expense spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ahunb86VoFSEdEhyaEs2YjZTVTJZeHpENnE0VDJ4bWc#gid=0).
* When you are paid, mark the reimbursment status as paid.
